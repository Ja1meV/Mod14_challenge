# Mod14_challenge

This is a Jupyter Notebook application that implements an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions. Train a model that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions. Adjust the input parameters of the trading algorithm, and compare its performance to that of a baseline model, tune baseline algorithm and evaluate new machine learning.

In this case first model predictins seem as the trend is better. The first model results closer to actual ones, but classification report shows that the first one has better quality of predictions. So perhaps model one just follows the first one, to make a decision I would run more models to make better predictions.
